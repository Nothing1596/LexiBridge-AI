# Student PDF Reading and Direct Concept Selection

## Product boundary

The PDF reader is an input surface for a one-concept query. It is not the
student's final learning output and it does not replace the concept learning
card. The product sequence is:

```text
authorized English PDF
  -> student directly selects one term or bounded phrase on the PDF page
  -> governed source/page/block/chunk/span mapping
  -> existing ConceptQuery and Task 12 alignment chain
  -> student-facing concept learning card
  -> private PersonalLearningRecord
```

The current phase closes the direct-selection input contract. The next ordered
interface phase owns the card presentation and must not move alignment logic
into the reader.

## Shared workspace flow

`PERSONAL` and `MANAGED_COURSE` use the same reader, selection mapper,
ConceptQuery DTO, alignment service, result serializer and private notebook.
Workspace scope changes ownership/membership checks and labels only.

```text
Personal Document / Managed Course Document
  -> DocumentParseRecord
  -> governed KnowledgeSource and KnowledgeChunk
  -> Student material access check
  -> authenticated original-PDF response
  -> browser-local Blob URL
  -> self-hosted PDF.js canvas + text layer
  -> exact governed chunk/span mapping
  -> server revalidation
  -> existing alignment result
```

No parser, embedding, retrieval, pairing, qualification, readiness, Provider,
card, or review workflow is duplicated.

## PDF.js runtime contract

The frontend vendors `pdfjs-dist@6.2.108` under `frontend/vendor/pdfjs` with
its Apache-2.0 license, runtime modules, character maps, standard fonts and
WASM resources. `manifest.json` pins the package version and SHA-256 hashes.
The browser loads every PDF.js asset from the LexiBridge origin; no CDN or
external runtime request is allowed.

The reader:

- obtains the original PDF through the existing authenticated Student file
  route;
- stores the response only as a browser-local Blob URL;
- renders the selected page to a canvas;
- renders PDF.js `TextLayer` for native pointer/text selection;
- keeps page navigation, the canvas and the selectable layer synchronized;
- revokes the Blob URL and destroys the PDF.js document on source change or
  logout;
- disables XFA and dynamic evaluation support;
- exposes no credential in a URL, DOM node, artifact or PDF.js module.

## Reader API

`student-material-reader@1.0.0` remains the server contract:

- `GET /api/student/concept-materials/{source_uid}/reader?page={page}`
- `GET /api/student/concept-materials/{source_uid}/file`

The JSON response provides one page of governed selectable items. Each item
contains the chunk UID, page, parse-block UID, heading path, block type,
content hash and chunk-relative span. Storage paths and full document bodies
are not serialized.

The file endpoint is Student-only and repeats the same exact owner or active
course-member check. It returns only an active accessible PDF with private,
no-store, nosniff and same-origin controls.

## Direct-selection mapping

The visual PDF text layer is never trusted as evidence by itself. A selection
is admitted only when normalized PDF.js text maps to exactly one selectable
governed reader item. The mapper returns:

- `chunk_uid`;
- exact text as stored in the governed chunk;
- chunk-relative `selection_start` and `selection_end`;
- page and block identity for local audit.

Whitespace and case differences introduced by PDF text extraction are
normalized while preserving an offset map back to the governed source text.
Repeated text is resolved only when its page occurrence order uniquely matches
the governed occurrence. Missing, overlong, outside-layer or ambiguous
selections fail closed with stable client reason codes. The client never
searches another page, top-k result or alternative chunk to manufacture a
mapping.

The existing ConceptQuery request remains unchanged:

```json
{
  "workspace_scope": "PERSONAL | MANAGED_COURSE",
  "source_uid": "opaque source UID",
  "chunk_uid": "opaque chunk UID",
  "selected_text": "bounded English concept",
  "selection_start": 0,
  "selection_end": 15
}
```

The server retrieves the authorized chunk again, verifies exact text and
offsets, reconstructs bounded context and persists source/page/block/span
provenance. Client mapping therefore cannot bypass server authorization or
evidence validation.

## Safe fallback

The governed parsed-text fallback is shown only when the original PDF is
unavailable or PDF.js cannot render a usable page. It is never displayed next
to a working PDF text layer. The fallback uses the same one-page reader DTO and
submits the same ConceptQuery contract. Missing provenance remains
non-selectable.

This fallback preserves access to evidence; it does not convert OCR output,
translation hints or arbitrary browser text into source evidence.

## Access and privacy

- Personal source: exact Student ownership and active private source.
- Managed Course source: active `CourseMember` and course-bound source.
- Other Student: not-found semantics.
- Instructor, Reviewer and Admin: denied by the Student-only route.
- Deleted/inactive source or unavailable file: no PDF response.
- Complete source text, Blob URLs, credentials and local paths are excluded
  from logs and artifacts.

Reading and selecting requires no LLM Provider. The core evidence result
remains available without a Provider. Automated acceptance uses temporary
databases and synthetic PDFs with zero application external API requests, zero
real Provider requests and no real credential reads.

## Reuse and migration decision

Reused objects are `Document`, `DocumentParseRecord`, `KnowledgeSource`,
`KnowledgeChunk`, `CourseMember`, `StudentConceptQuery` and
`PersonalLearningRecord`. No schema migration is required.

The old flat `/chunks` compatibility endpoint remains unchanged but is not
used by the student reader. The former iframe plus separate parsed-text column
has been removed from the product UI. API deprecation remains a separate task.
