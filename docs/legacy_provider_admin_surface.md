# Legacy Provider Admin Surface Audit

Task: 9C.4H
Baseline commit: `b9b5b0a53b5db6a89911bd659a9ec6c39b0c49dd`
Branch: `audit/legacy-provider-admin-9c4h`
Status: characterization and boundary audit. Task 9C.4I has since extracted only the legacy observability GET views: `/api/admin/ai/calls`, `/api/admin/ai/usage`, and `/api/admin/ai/health`. Task 9C.4K has since extracted the seed-backed legacy configuration GET views: `/api/admin/ai/providers`, `/api/admin/ai/models`, and `/api/admin/ai/prompts`. Task 9C.4N has since extracted the thin legacy healthcheck POST route while keeping live probe disabled. Task 9C.4O has since characterized prompt mutation and concluded `PROMPT_VERSIONING_OR_CONCURRENCY_POLICY_REQUIRED_FIRST`. Task 9C.4P accepts `LEGACY_PROMPT_MUTABLE_REVISION_V1` as the small-pilot compatibility policy for that mutation surface.

## Scope

This audit covers the legacy provider admin surface under `/api/admin/ai/*` and its overlap with the formal alignment-provider governance APIs. It does not cover or migrate `POST /api/alignment/run`; that route remains a separate legacy execution surface that needs its own service boundary.

Unknown legacy provider admin route count after scan: `0`.

## Route Inventory

| Route | Method | Endpoint | Handler lines | Classification | Auth/roles | OpenAPI | Frontend | Seed helper | Writes | Network risk | Recommendation |
|---|---:|---|---:|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|---|---|
| `/api/admin/ai/providers` | GET | `admin_ai_providers` | module | `EXTRACTED_SEED_BACKED_CONFIGURATION_VIEW` | admin only | yes | yes | yes | seed flush only; no commit | no | extracted in `backend/routes/legacy_provider_admin_configuration.py` |
| `/api/admin/ai/models` | GET | `admin_ai_models` | module | `EXTRACTED_SEED_BACKED_CONFIGURATION_VIEW` | admin only | yes | yes | yes | seed flush only; no commit | no | extracted in `backend/routes/legacy_provider_admin_configuration.py` |
| `/api/admin/ai/prompts` | GET | `admin_ai_prompts` | module | `EXTRACTED_SEED_BACKED_CONFIGURATION_VIEW` | admin only | yes | yes | yes | seed flush only; no commit | no | extracted in `backend/routes/legacy_provider_admin_configuration.py`; POST still app-owned mutation callback |
| `/api/admin/ai/prompts` | POST | `admin_ai_prompts` | 22 callback lines | `LEGACY_MUTATION` | admin only | yes | no direct frontend call found | yes | upserts `PromptTemplate`, commits, can persist seed rows | no | implement service next using `LEGACY_PROMPT_MUTABLE_REVISION_V1` |
| `/api/admin/ai/calls` | GET | `admin_ai_calls` | module | `EXTRACTED_LEGACY_OBSERVABILITY_VIEW` | admin only | yes | yes | no | none | no | extracted in `backend/routes/legacy_provider_admin_observability.py` |
| `/api/admin/ai/usage` | GET | `admin_ai_usage` | module | `EXTRACTED_LEGACY_OBSERVABILITY_VIEW` | admin only | yes | yes | no | none | no | extracted in `backend/routes/legacy_provider_admin_observability.py` |
| `/api/admin/ai/health` | GET | `admin_ai_health` | module | `EXTRACTED_LEGACY_OBSERVABILITY_VIEW` | admin only | yes | yes | yes | seed flush only; no commit | no | extracted as local health view, not live probe |
| `/api/admin/ai/healthcheck` | POST | `admin_ai_healthcheck` | module | `EXTRACTED_LEGACY_HEALTHCHECK_ROUTE` | admin only | yes | no direct frontend call found | yes | commits provider health and may persist env seed | no through legacy endpoint; live probe returns disabled result | extracted in `backend/routes/legacy_provider_admin_healthcheck.py` |

All routes keep the existing legacy response convention from `api_success`: top-level `status`, `message`, and `data`. None of these legacy admin AI routes returns `request_id` today.

## Formal API Overlap Matrix

| Legacy route | Formal route | Same source | Same fields | Same roles | Same side effects | Frontend replaceable |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `/api/admin/ai/providers` | `/api/alignment/providers` | partial | no | no; legacy is admin-only, formal allows teacher/admin | no; legacy can seed-flush registry rows | possible only with field mapping |
| `/api/admin/ai/models` | none | no | no | no | no | no direct formal replacement |
| `/api/admin/ai/prompts` GET | none | no | no | no | no | no direct formal replacement |
| `/api/admin/ai/calls` | none | no | no | no | no | no direct formal replacement |
| `/api/admin/ai/usage` | `/api/alignment/providers/<provider_name>/usage` | no; legacy uses `AICallLog`, formal uses alignment provider usage | no | no | no | no |
| `/api/admin/ai/health` | `/api/alignment/providers/<provider_name>/preflight` | no | no | no | no; health may seed-flush legacy registry | no |
| `/api/admin/ai/healthcheck` | `/api/alignment/providers/<provider_name>/preflight` POST | no | no | no | no; healthcheck mutates legacy provider health and can call transport | no |

The legacy surface is not a simple alias of the 9C.4A-9C.4C formal provider governance/preflight surface. It is an active UI contract over legacy provider registry, model registry, prompt templates, AI call logs, usage summaries, and provider health state.

## Registry Seed Side Effects

| Route | Calls `ensure_ai_registry_seed` | GET/POST | Persistent without explicit commit | What can be flushed | Characterized behavior |
|---|---:|---|---:|---|---|
| `/api/admin/ai/providers` | yes | GET | no | `AIProviderConfig`, `AIModelRegistry`, `PromptTemplate` | first request returns seeded rows but they are not persisted after the request without a later commit |
| `/api/admin/ai/models` | yes | GET | no | same | response may include flushed seed rows |
| `/api/admin/ai/prompts` | yes | GET | no | same | response may include flushed prompt defaults |
| `/api/admin/ai/prompts` | yes | POST | yes | same plus target `PromptTemplate` | mutation commits prompt changes and may also persist seed rows |
| `/api/admin/ai/calls` | no | GET | n/a | none | no registry seed |
| `/api/admin/ai/usage` | no | GET | n/a | none | no registry seed |
| `/api/admin/ai/health` | yes | GET | no | same | response may include flushed seed rows |
| `/api/admin/ai/healthcheck` | yes | POST | yes | same plus provider health fields | commits health fields and may persist env-selected seed rows |

This seed behavior is the main reason the legacy read-only views should be extracted separately from prompt mutation and healthcheck. A future cleanup can move seed initialization to startup, migration, or an explicit service, but 9C.4H does not change current behavior.

## Task 9C.4J Seed Service Boundary

Task 9C.4J moves the legacy provider registry seed implementation into `backend/services/legacy_provider_registry_seed.py`.

The new service owns only the legacy get-or-create and `flush` behavior for:

- `AIProviderConfig`
- `AIModelRegistry`
- `PromptTemplate`

It does not import Flask, `backend.app`, or route modules. It does not read credentials, create HTTP responses, call provider transport, execute health probes, write `AuditRecord`, or call `commit`/`rollback`. Existing callers still decide transaction outcome.

`backend/app.py` keeps a minimal compatibility wrapper named `ensure_ai_registry_seed(...)` so existing route and non-route callers keep their public call shape. The wrapper builds the environment provider selection and delegates to `ensure_legacy_provider_registry_seed(...)`.

### Seed Transaction Matrix

| Caller | Seed invoked | Flush | Caller commit | Caller rollback | Persistence after request |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `GET /api/admin/ai/providers` | yes | yes, for missing seed rows | no explicit commit | request teardown/session cleanup | seed rows are visible in the response transaction but are not persisted without a later commit |
| `GET /api/admin/ai/models` | yes | yes, for missing seed rows | no explicit commit | request teardown/session cleanup | same as providers GET |
| `GET /api/admin/ai/prompts` | yes | yes, for missing seed rows | no explicit commit | request teardown/session cleanup | same as providers GET |
| `GET /api/admin/ai/health` | yes, through `registry_seed_service` in the route module | yes, for missing seed rows | no explicit commit | request teardown/session cleanup | same as providers GET |
| `POST /api/admin/ai/prompts` | yes | yes, for missing seed rows | yes, after prompt mutation succeeds | caller/session rollback on failure | prompt changes and any missing seed rows are persisted only on the existing POST commit |
| `POST /api/admin/ai/healthcheck` | yes | yes, for missing seed rows | yes, after health fields are updated | caller/session rollback on failure | provider health changes and any missing seed rows are persisted only on the existing POST commit |
| `call_ai_task(...)` | yes | yes, for missing seed rows | owned by the caller path | owned by the caller path | unchanged from the historical helper |
| `ai_selection_from_config(...)` fallback | yes | yes, for missing seed rows | owned by the caller path | owned by the caller path | unchanged from the historical helper |

Characterization and service tests confirm:

- first service call creates and flushes missing provider/model/prompt rows;
- repeated calls in the same or later session do not create duplicate seed rows;
- caller rollback removes uncommitted seed rows;
- caller commit persists seed rows;
- partial seed state is completed without duplicating existing provider/model/prompt natural keys;
- service-level flush exceptions propagate to the caller and leave rollback ownership with the caller.

Current uniqueness is mostly enforced by lookup-before-create natural keys rather than formal unique constraints:

- provider: `provider_name`
- model: `provider_name` + `model_name`
- prompt: `prompt_key` + `prompt_version`

This preserves compatibility but remains vulnerable to concurrent duplicate creation if two sessions seed the same missing row at the same time. A later production hardening task should move stable defaults into migration/startup seed with explicit uniqueness or conflict handling.

## Healthcheck Execution Matrix

| Provider type | Credential present | `live_probe` | Transport called | Network risk | Result contract |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `none` | no | false/true | no | no | unhealthy, local message |
| `mock` | n/a | false/true | no | no | healthy, development-only message |
| `local_heuristic` | n/a | false/true | no | no | healthy, development-only message |
| live provider, missing/placeholder credential | no | false/true | no | no | unhealthy, missing-key message |
| live provider, usable credential | yes | false | no | no | unknown, live probe skipped |
| live provider, usable credential | yes | true | no, disabled at legacy route boundary | no | unknown with `LEGACY_LIVE_PROBE_DISABLED` |

The 9C.4L.1 test suite verifies the route no longer passes `live_probe=True` through to healthcheck logic for an enabled live provider. It uses a spy and blocked socket/HTTP primitives to prove transport and adapter call counts stay at zero.

## Network And Secret Boundary

No-network coverage exists for:

- all legacy admin AI GET routes;
- unauthorized and role-denied paths;
- local healthcheck paths;
- `live_probe=false`;
- mock/local provider healthcheck;
- service-level live-probe transport intent via spy, without allowing a real connection.

Sentinel used by 9C.4H: `LEXIBRIDGE_SENTINEL_SECRET_9C4H`.

The current legacy serializers do not return API key fields. They do return non-secret operational fields such as `base_url`, token limits, cost estimates, health status, redacted prompt previews, and redacted response previews. A future healthcheck service boundary must keep transport exception text and live provider response summaries sanitized before returning them through `/api/admin/ai/healthcheck`.

## Write-set Matrix

| Route | Provider registry | Model registry | PromptTemplate | AICallLog | Usage | VerificationRun | ProviderPolicy | Preflight | AuditRecord |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| providers GET | possible flush, no commit | possible flush, no commit | possible flush, no commit | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| models GET | possible flush, no commit | possible flush, no commit | possible flush, no commit | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| prompts GET | possible flush, no commit | possible flush, no commit | possible flush, no commit | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| prompts POST | possible committed seed | possible committed seed | create/update commit | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| calls GET | 0 | 0 | 0 | read | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| usage GET | 0 | 0 | 0 | read | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| health GET | possible flush, no commit | possible flush, no commit | possible flush, no commit | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| healthcheck POST | committed seed possible; health fields commit | committed seed possible | committed seed possible | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

No route in `/api/admin/ai/*` writes `AlignmentVerificationRun`, `AlignmentProviderUsageRecord`, `AlignmentProviderPolicy`, `AlignmentProviderPreflightRun`, or `AuditRecord` under current characterization.

## Permissions

All `/api/admin/ai/*` routes are admin-only.

- unauthenticated: 401;
- student: 403;
- teacher: 403;
- admin: allowed.

Course permissions are not consulted by this surface. Provider existence, credential state, and registry details are not exposed to non-admin roles through these routes.

## Frontend And OpenAPI Dependencies

`frontend/index.html` currently calls:

- `/api/admin/ai/providers`
- `/api/admin/ai/models`
- `/api/admin/ai/prompts`
- `/api/admin/ai/calls`
- `/api/admin/ai/usage`
- `/api/admin/ai/health`

No direct frontend call to `/api/admin/ai/healthcheck` was found. The healthcheck route is still listed in OpenAPI and tested, so it cannot be removed or renamed without a compatibility plan.

All `/api/admin/ai/*` routes are present in `docs/openapi.yaml`.

## Deprecation And Migration Suitability

| Route | Suitability |
|---|---|
| `/api/admin/ai/providers` GET | `EXTRACTED_SEED_BACKED_CONFIGURATION_VIEW`; keep legacy shim/API contract |
| `/api/admin/ai/models` GET | `EXTRACTED_SEED_BACKED_CONFIGURATION_VIEW`; keep legacy shim/API contract |
| `/api/admin/ai/prompts` GET | `EXTRACTED_SEED_BACKED_CONFIGURATION_VIEW`; shared endpoint preserved while POST mutation remains separate |
| `/api/admin/ai/prompts` POST | `LEGACY_PROMPT_MUTABLE_REVISION_V1` accepted after 9C.4P; service extraction is next, route extraction still later |
| `/api/admin/ai/calls` GET | `KEEP_AND_EXTRACT` inside legacy read-only view group |
| `/api/admin/ai/usage` GET | `KEEP_AND_EXTRACT` inside legacy read-only view group |
| `/api/admin/ai/health` GET | `KEEP_AND_EXTRACT` as local health view only |
| `/api/admin/ai/healthcheck` POST | `EXTRACTED_LEGACY_HEALTHCHECK_ROUTE`; keep legacy live probe disabled and keep future live probing as a new explicit service |

## Complexity Snapshot

| Endpoint | Lines | Direct models | Helper/service calls | Returns | Writes | Network risk | Migration suitability |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `admin_ai_providers` | module | 1 | seed service, metadata, serializer | 1 | seed flush only | no | extracted seed-backed configuration view |
| `admin_ai_models` | module | 1 | seed service, serializer | 1 | seed flush only | no | extracted seed-backed configuration view |
| `admin_ai_prompts` GET | module | 1 | seed service, serializer | 1 | seed flush only | no | extracted seed-backed configuration view; POST callback remains app-owned |
| `admin_ai_prompts` POST | 22 callback lines | 1 | seed callback, validation, serializer | 2 | commit | no | version/default/concurrency policy boundary first |
| `admin_ai_calls` | 6 | 1 | serializer | 1 | 0 | no | read-only extraction candidate |
| `admin_ai_usage` | 6 | 1 | summary serializer | 1 | 0 | no | read-only extraction candidate |
| `admin_ai_health` | 7 | 1 | seed, serializer | 1 | seed flush only | no | read-only extraction candidate |
| `admin_ai_healthcheck` | module | 1 | seed, local readiness service | 1 | commit health/seed | no through legacy route | extracted thin route; future live probe must be a new service |

## Final Conclusion

Primary conclusion: `SPLIT_READONLY_AND_HEALTHCHECK_FIRST`.

Reasoning:

- The legacy admin AI GET views are active frontend/OpenAPI surface and are not drop-in aliases of formal provider governance APIs.
- Several GET views have a seed-flush side effect but do not commit by themselves.
- `POST /api/admin/ai/prompts` is a mutation sharing the same handler as prompt GET.
- `POST /api/admin/ai/healthcheck` commits provider health fields. After 9C.4M, local readiness and live-probe-disabled results are computed by `backend/services/legacy_provider_local_readiness.py`.
- There are no unknown `/api/admin/ai/*` routes after scan.

Next precise slice: audit `POST /api/admin/ai/prompts` mutation and its transaction boundary. Do not re-enable live transport probing without a new explicit live-probe service, and keep legacy `/api/alignment/run` separate.

## Task 9C.4I Update

Task 9C.4I implements the first half of the split by extracting only:

- `GET /api/admin/ai/calls`
- `GET /api/admin/ai/usage`
- `GET /api/admin/ai/health`

The new module preserves the legacy active API contract: admin-only access, endpoint names, `api_success` envelopes without `request_id`, id-desc limits, local health seed-flush behavior, no view `AuditRecord`, no provider transport, and no live probe. It does not migrate provider/model/prompt configuration views, `POST /api/admin/ai/prompts`, `POST /api/admin/ai/healthcheck`, `/api/alignment/run`, credential management, replay, or any provider execution path.

## Task 9C.4K Update

Task 9C.4K extracts only the seed-backed legacy configuration GET views into `backend/routes/legacy_provider_admin_configuration.py`:

- `GET /api/admin/ai/providers`
- `GET /api/admin/ai/models`
- `GET /api/admin/ai/prompts`

The module calls `ensure_legacy_provider_registry_seed(...)` directly as an explicit domain dependency and preserves the legacy compatibility contract: admin-only access, endpoint names, OpenAPI/frontend URLs, `api_success` envelopes without `request_id`, no view `AuditRecord`, provider/model/prompt ordering, and seed flush/no-explicit-commit behavior. Legitimate prompt metadata remains part of the prompt GET contract, while credential-like provider/model metadata remains excluded from responses.

`POST /api/admin/ai/prompts` still keeps its mutation logic in `backend/app.py` through an explicit `prompt_post_handler` callback because Flask requires the shared `admin_ai_prompts` endpoint to remain stable for both methods. Task 9C.4P has defined the compatibility policy for the next service extraction: mutable key/version revision upsert, runtime-compatible validation, single-writer last-commit-wins, and future service-owned commit/explicit rollback. `/api/alignment/run` remains a separate future task, and legacy live transport probing is disabled.

## Task 9C.4L Healthcheck Boundary Audit

Task 9C.4L does not migrate `POST /api/admin/ai/healthcheck` and does not change production behavior. The detailed audit is in `docs/legacy_provider_healthcheck_boundary.md`.

Additional findings:

- The route remains admin-only, OpenAPI-listed, and not directly called by `frontend/index.html`.
- The handler still calls `ensure_ai_registry_seed(...)`, reads optional `live_probe`, loops over enabled `AIProviderConfig` rows, writes health fields, commits, and returns the legacy `api_success` envelope without `request_id`.
- Local readiness is separable from live probing: `none`, `mock`, `local_heuristic`, missing credential, and `live_probe=false` paths do not need provider transport.
- Before 9C.4L.1, live probe started for an enabled live provider with a usable credential and `live_probe=true`.
- The lower-level health helper still echoes adapter/provider error `message` if called directly. 9C.4L.1 blocks that helper path from the legacy route, so the active route no longer exposes raw adapter messages.

Primary conclusion after 9C.4L: `DISABLE_OR_DEPRECATE_LIVE_PROBE_FIRST`.

9C.4L.1 implements that safety step. `live_probe=true` now returns a safe disabled result, with `error_code=LEGACY_LIVE_PROBE_DISABLED`, and does not call provider adapter or transport. 9C.4M moves the local readiness decisions into `backend/services/legacy_provider_local_readiness.py`. 9C.4N moves the thin healthcheck adapter into `backend/routes/legacy_provider_admin_healthcheck.py` while preserving route-owned commit behavior.

## Task 9C.4O Prompt Mutation Boundary Audit

Task 9C.4O does not migrate `POST /api/admin/ai/prompts` and does not change production behavior. The detailed audit is in `docs/legacy_provider_prompt_mutation_boundary.md`.

Confirmed contract:

- GET and POST share the same Flask rule and endpoint: `/api/admin/ai/prompts`, `admin_ai_prompts`.
- GET is implemented by `backend/routes/legacy_provider_admin_configuration.py`.
- POST delegates through the explicit `prompt_post_handler(user)` callback to `backend/app.py::admin_ai_prompts_post_handler(user)`.
- The POST callback is a 22-line upsert over `PromptTemplate` keyed by `prompt_key` and `prompt_version`.
- The implementation requires only `prompt_key` and `prompt_version`; OpenAPI currently also marks `task_type` and `template_text` as required.
- Success uses the legacy `api_success` envelope without `request_id`.
- No prompt mutation `AuditRecord` is written.
- The callback has one explicit `db.session.commit()` and no explicit rollback.
- A successful mutation can persist missing registry seed rows that were flushed earlier by the shared route module.
- Legal prompt template content is stored as business data; unknown credential-like metadata is ignored and not persisted.
- Versioning, active/default exclusivity, uniqueness, optimistic locking, and conflict behavior are not fully defined.

Primary conclusion after 9C.4O: `PROMPT_VERSIONING_OR_CONCURRENCY_POLICY_REQUIRED_FIRST`.

Policy accepted after 9C.4P: `LEGACY_PROMPT_MUTABLE_REVISION_V1`, documented in `docs/adr/ADR-legacy-prompt-mutation-policy.md`.

Next precise step: extract a prompt mutation application service that preserves the accepted compatibility policy, moves transaction ownership out of the route callback, and adds explicit rollback. Do not migrate the POST route until that service exists.
