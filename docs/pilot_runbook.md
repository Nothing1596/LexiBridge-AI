# Pilot Runbook

Updated: 2026-07-10

This runbook is for local demo and small-course pilot operation. It is not a production deployment guide.

## Environment Requirements

- Python virtual environment: `backend/.venv-macos/bin/python` when present.
- SQLite database for local/demo/small pilot.
- Browser capable of opening `frontend/index.html`.
- No external LLM provider is required or enabled.
- Do not place real API keys in `.env`, README, demo fixtures, logs, or release packages.

## Safe Configuration

Use environment variables similar to:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:////absolute/path/to/lexibridge.db
UPLOAD_FOLDER=/absolute/path/to/uploads
AUTH_REQUIRED=True
AI_PROVIDER=none
ALLOW_MOCK_AI=True
OCR_PROVIDER=none
FORMULA_OCR_PROVIDER=none
```

External provider keys such as `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` are not needed for the pilot. External provider classes remain disabled by policy/governance gates.

## Database Initialization

Run:

```bash
backend/.venv-macos/bin/python scripts/migrate_db.py
```

The current migration mechanism is `db.create_all()` plus additive `ensure_schema_columns()`. It is suitable for local development, demo, and small-scale pilot upgrade checks. It is not a production-grade Alembic migration system.

## Demo Seed

Create or refresh demo data:

```bash
backend/.venv-macos/bin/python scripts/seed_review_demo.py --reset-demo
```

Repeat without reset to verify idempotency:

```bash
backend/.venv-macos/bin/python scripts/seed_review_demo.py
```

The seed creates local-only demo users, course review policy/permissions, student memberships, visibility policies, governed evidence, reviewable cards, approved student cards, learning states, student feedback, and teacher analytics data.

## Start Backend

For local demo:

```bash
backend/.venv-macos/bin/python backend/app.py
```

or use the existing run script if configured:

```bash
scripts/run_backend.sh
```

Flask's development server is not a production deployment boundary.

## Open Frontend

Open:

```text
frontend/index.html
```

Use the login form with the demo credentials printed by `scripts/seed_review_demo.py`.

## Demo Accounts

Demo accounts are local-only and must not be used in production. The seed prints:

- demo teacher
- demo admin
- demo student
- second demo student for analytics distribution

## Core Demo Route

1. Log in as demo teacher.
2. Open `Concept Card Review`.
3. Review the queue for `DEMO Signals and Systems`.
4. Open a card and inspect English/Chinese evidence, risk labels, verification summary, and review history.
5. Try approving a blocking-risk card and observe backend policy rejection with `request_id`.
6. Log in as demo admin.
7. Approve a card with explicit risk override reason.
8. Log in as demo student.
9. Open `Concept Cards`.
10. Confirm approved cards for `DEMO Signals and Systems` are visible.
11. Confirm `DEMO Hidden Course` cards are not visible.
12. Favorite and mark a card mastered.
13. Submit feedback and export favorited cards.
14. Return to demo teacher.
15. Open `Student Feedback` and triage feedback.
16. Open `Course Learning Analytics` and inspect summary, chapter table, low-mastery list, feedback hotspots, and export.

## Provider Boundary

- `mock-rule-v1` is deterministic mock/rule based.
- `fake-llm-v1` simulates LLM JSON output for parser/gate tests.
- `external-llm-replay-v1` replays local fixtures and does not call the network.
- `deepseek-alignment-v1-disabled` is registered as disabled and must fail safely.

Current pilot has no real LLM production verification.

## Checks

Run release safety:

```bash
backend/.venv-macos/bin/python scripts/check_release_safety.py
```

Run development checks:

```bash
backend/.venv-macos/bin/python scripts/dev_check.py
```

Run pilot readiness:

```bash
backend/.venv-macos/bin/python scripts/pilot_readiness_check.py
```

For a small pilot profile with JSON output:

```bash
backend/.venv-macos/bin/python scripts/pilot_readiness_check.py \
  --profile small-pilot \
  --json-output /private/tmp/lexibridge-pilot-result.json
```

For a faster local loop:

```bash
backend/.venv-macos/bin/python scripts/pilot_readiness_check.py --skip-full-tests
```

Readiness verdicts:

- `READY`: no blocking failures and no remaining operating conditions.
- `READY_WITH_CONDITIONS`: all pilot blockers passed, but operation is bounded by conditions such as SQLite, Flask dev server, disabled external LLM, local demo accounts, no formal migrations, or unavailable browser runtime.
- `NOT_READY`: a blocking check failed. Do not start the pilot until fixed.

The current expected result for local demo or small-course pilot is `READY_WITH_CONDITIONS`, not unqualified `READY`.

## Backup SQLite And Uploads

Stop writes before backup. Then run:

```bash
backend/.venv-macos/bin/python scripts/pilot_backup.py \
  --database /absolute/path/to/lexibridge.db \
  --uploads /absolute/path/to/uploads \
  --output /private/tmp/lexibridge-pilot-backup
```

The backup directory contains:

- `database.sqlite`
- `uploads/`
- `backup_manifest.json`

The manifest records SHA-256 hashes, table counts, file counts, sizes, timestamp, and commit. It does not include `.env`, Authorization, Cookie, API keys, or provider secrets.

Verify the backup:

```bash
backend/.venv-macos/bin/python scripts/verify_pilot_backup.py \
  --backup /private/tmp/lexibridge-pilot-backup
```

If the backup is tampered with or hash checks fail, verification returns non-zero.

## Restore SQLite

Restore to new targets first:

```bash
backend/.venv-macos/bin/python scripts/pilot_restore.py \
  --backup /private/tmp/lexibridge-pilot-backup \
  --database-target /absolute/path/to/restored.db \
  --uploads-target /absolute/path/to/restored-uploads
```

Restore behavior:

- validates manifest and all SHA-256 values before copying;
- refuses to overwrite existing targets unless `--force` is passed;
- does not restore `.env` or secrets;
- runs SQLite `integrity_check`;
- checks core tables after restore.

After restore:

1. Point `DATABASE_URL` and `UPLOAD_FOLDER` to the restored targets.
2. Run `backend/.venv-macos/bin/python scripts/migrate_db.py`.
3. Run `backend/.venv-macos/bin/python scripts/pilot_readiness_check.py --skip-full-tests`.
4. Keep external providers disabled during recovery verification.

## Browser E2E

Run browser E2E separately:

```bash
backend/.venv-macos/bin/python scripts/run_browser_e2e.py \
  --json-output /private/tmp/lexibridge-browser-e2e.json
```

If Python Playwright or Chromium is not installed, the script returns `E2E_ENVIRONMENT_UNAVAILABLE` with exit code `2`; this is not a pass. In readiness, that state becomes `READY_WITH_CONDITIONS` with `browser_e2e_not_executed`.

Install runtime in the project environment before making browser E2E a blocking gate:

```bash
backend/.venv-macos/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements-e2e.txt
backend/.venv-macos/bin/python -m playwright install chromium
```

Do not run those installation commands in environments that must stay offline. Browser E2E uses only localhost once the runtime exists.

Headed debug run:

```bash
backend/.venv-macos/bin/python scripts/run_browser_e2e.py \
  --headed \
  --keep-artifacts \
  --json-output /private/tmp/lexibridge-browser-e2e-debug.json
```

Run only one flow when isolating failures:

```bash
backend/.venv-macos/bin/python scripts/run_browser_e2e.py --student-only
backend/.venv-macos/bin/python scripts/run_browser_e2e.py --teacher-only
```

The browser runner:

- creates a temporary SQLite database and uploads directory;
- runs migration and demo seed;
- starts a local Flask server on a random port;
- serves `frontend/index.html` with local `API_BASE`;
- runs student and teacher DOM flows;
- blocks non-localhost requests;
- records JavaScript errors, page errors, failed requests, blocked external URLs, downloads, and failure screenshots to a temporary artifact directory.

Current local browser gate baseline:

- Python Playwright: `1.60.0`;
- Chromium: `148.0.7778.96`;
- student and teacher flows pass in real Chromium;
- console errors and page errors must remain empty;
- page-owned external dependency requests must remain empty;
- deliberate probe requests are blocked and recorded separately.

Browser E2E troubleshooting:

- If strict selectors fail, add stable `data-testid` attributes instead of relying on text-only selectors.
- If a page-owned external URL is blocked, remove the remote dependency or document it as high technical debt.
- If CSV/JSON export fails, inspect the download entry in the JSON result and the artifact directory.
- If Playwright cannot launch Chromium from the sandboxed terminal, run the browser command with the approved local runtime access used by the pilot host.
- Clean temporary artifacts by deleting the `artifacts_directory` reported in the JSON result when `--keep-artifacts` is used.

## Clean Demo Data

Run:

```bash
backend/.venv-macos/bin/python scripts/seed_review_demo.py --reset-demo
```

This resets and recreates the demo namespace. It does not delete arbitrary user/course data outside the demo markers.

## View AuditRecord

Use admin APIs or inspect SQLite locally for `audit_record`. Audit payloads are summaries only and should not contain Authorization, Cookie, API keys, full prompts, raw provider output, or full evidence text.

## Common Troubleshooting

- `AUTH_REQUIRED` errors: log in again and use the returned bearer token.
- Empty student cards: verify `StudentCourseMembership`, `CourseStudentVisibilityPolicy`, and `ConceptAlignmentCard.status=approved`.
- Review queue empty for teacher: verify `CourseReviewPermission`.
- Provider disabled: expected for external providers unless a future explicit provider task changes policy.
- Upload blocked: inspect `DocumentParseRecord.quality_status` and quality flags.

## Rollback

For a local/small pilot rollback:

1. Stop backend.
2. Verify the last backup with `scripts/verify_pilot_backup.py`.
3. Restore SQLite and uploads with `scripts/pilot_restore.py`.
4. Do not reuse demo credentials in real pilots.
5. Keep external providers disabled.
6. Re-run `scripts/pilot_readiness_check.py --skip-full-tests`.

## Pre-Pilot Checklist

- `scripts/check_release_safety.py` passes.
- `scripts/dev_check.py` passes.
- `scripts/pilot_readiness_check.py --profile small-pilot` returns `READY_WITH_CONDITIONS`.
- A backup has been created, verified, and restored to a temporary target.
- Browser E2E has passed in real Chromium. `E2E_ENVIRONMENT_UNAVAILABLE` is acceptable only for diagnostic local runs before the pilot gate is active, not for starting a 9B.1-hardened pilot.
- SQLite single-writer limits are acceptable for the planned pilot.
- Flask dev server boundary is accepted for the local/demo setting.
- Demo accounts are marked local-only and cleaned after the session.
- External LLM providers remain disabled.
