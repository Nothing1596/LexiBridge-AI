# Legacy Provider Prompt Mutation Boundary

Task: 9C.4O through 9C.4Q
Baseline commits: `6aabc47b3c9be79c7ea0e33efc6b2b52c1856878` for the boundary audit, `a8c4d1de12100fb128c3b54a25d5f218a122f012` for service extraction.
Branches: `audit/legacy-provider-prompt-mutation-9c4o`, `refactor/legacy-prompt-mutation-service-9c4q`.
Status: `POLICY_ACCEPTED`; `APPLICATION_SERVICE_ESTABLISHED`; `POST_ROUTE_NOT_YET_EXTRACTED`. The shared route, API contract, schema, frontend, and OpenAPI remain unchanged.

## Scope

This audit covers only:

- `POST /api/admin/ai/prompts`

It does not migrate the route, extract a service, modify the shared prompt route module, or touch legacy `/api/alignment/run`.

## Registration Contract

`GET /api/admin/ai/prompts` and `POST /api/admin/ai/prompts` are registered as a single Flask rule by `backend/routes/legacy_provider_admin_configuration.py`:

- URL: `/api/admin/ai/prompts`
- Methods: `GET`, `POST`
- Flask endpoint: `admin_ai_prompts`
- Registration function: `register_legacy_provider_admin_configuration_routes(...)`
- GET handler: local `admin_ai_prompts()` function in the configuration route module
- POST handler: delegated to the explicit `prompt_post_handler(user)` callback
- Callback implementation: `backend/app.py::admin_ai_prompts_post_handler(user)`

`backend/app.py` no longer has an `@app.route("/api/admin/ai/prompts")` decorator. It still defines the POST mutation callback and passes it to the configuration route module to preserve the shared endpoint name.

## HTTP Contract

| Field | Current behavior |
|---|---|
| URL | `/api/admin/ai/prompts` |
| Method | `POST` |
| Endpoint | `admin_ai_prompts` |
| Auth | required |
| Roles | admin only |
| Unauthenticated | 401 |
| Student/teacher/reviewer | 403 |
| Success | 200 |
| Success envelope | `status`, `message`, `data` |
| Success `request_id` | absent |
| AuditRecord | none |
| Required by implementation | `prompt_key`, `prompt_version` |
| Required by OpenAPI | `prompt_key`, `prompt_version`, `task_type`, `template_text` |
| Empty JSON object | 400 `VALIDATION_ERROR` |
| Malformed JSON | 400 |
| Empty non-JSON body | 415 |
| Non-object JSON | currently reaches a 500 error path |
| Unknown fields | ignored |
| Network/transport | none |

The OpenAPI required field list is stricter than the implementation. The implementation accepts `task_type` and `template_text` as optional because it falls back to existing values or defaults.

## Handler Location And Complexity

Callback: `backend/app.py::admin_ai_prompts_post_handler(user)`.

Current callback size after Task 9C.4Q: 12 lines.

The callback is now a thin HTTP adapter:

- `request.get_json()`
- `LegacyPromptMutationRequest.from_payload(...)`
- `execute_legacy_prompt_mutation(...)`
- `api_error(...)`
- `api_success(...)`
- `serialize_prompt_template(...)`

The callback no longer queries, creates, updates, commits, or rolls back `PromptTemplate` directly.

## Mutation Operation Matrix

| Operation | How selected | Required fields | Target lookup | Rows created | Rows updated | Commit | Response |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Upsert prompt template version | no action field; lookup by `prompt_key` + `prompt_version` | implementation requires `prompt_key`, `prompt_version` | first `PromptTemplate` with matching key/version | 1 if absent | 1 if present | yes | serialized prompt without `template_text` |

No separate create, update, activate, deactivate, set-default, reset, archive, or create-version operation exists in the current HTTP contract. `is_active` and `is_default` are direct field assignments on the target prompt row.

## Prompt Model

Current model: `PromptTemplate`.

Fields:

- `id`
- `prompt_key`
- `prompt_version`
- `task_type`
- `language`
- `template_text`
- `json_schema`
- `is_active`
- `is_default`
- `created_by`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`
- `notes`

Observed model properties:

- No provider relation.
- No model relation.
- No course relation.
- No version history table.
- No explicit uniqueness constraint on `prompt_key` + `prompt_version`.
- No optimistic locking field.
- No seed-row immutability marker.

The effective natural key is `prompt_key` + `prompt_version`, enforced by lookup-before-create rather than a database constraint.

## Validation

Current validation is service-owned and intentionally minimal:

- `prompt_key` is stringified, stripped, and required.
- `prompt_version` is stringified, stripped, and required.
- JSON `null` is stringified to `"None"` and accepted for `prompt_key` or `prompt_version`; this is a legacy runtime quirk, not a recommended production validation rule.
- `task_type` is stringified and stripped; fallback is existing `task_type` or `prompt_key`.
- `language` is stringified and stripped; fallback is existing `language` or `bilingual`.
- `template_text` is stringified and stripped; fallback is existing template text or empty string.
- `json_schema` stores JSON text for dict/list values and stringifies other values.
- `is_active` and `is_default` use Python `bool(...)` coercion.
- `notes` is stringified and stripped.
- Unknown fields are ignored.

There is no current server-side validation for:

- maximum template length;
- placeholder syntax;
- JSON schema shape beyond dict/list/string storage behavior;
- duplicate prompt versions under concurrent writes;
- one-active or one-default policy;
- seed prompt immutability;
- no-op update detection;
- client/server version conflict.

## Legal Template Versus Secret Boundary

Prompt template content is legitimate business data. Current mutation saves `template_text` exactly as the stripped template body and does not treat normal instruction text as a secret.

Secret-like data must be distinguished from legitimate template content. Characterization uses `LEXIBRIDGE_SENTINEL_SECRET_9C4O` only in unknown credential-like fields such as API-key or authorization metadata, not as the prompt body itself.

Current behavior:

- unknown credential-like fields are ignored;
- unknown sentinel metadata is not persisted to `PromptTemplate`;
- the success response does not include unknown fields;
- `serialize_prompt_template(...)` does not return `template_text`;
- no `AuditRecord` is written.

## Versioning

Current version semantics:

- The client supplies `prompt_version`.
- The server does not call `model_version_factory`.
- A missing `prompt_key` + `prompt_version` creates a new row.
- An existing `prompt_key` + `prompt_version` is updated in place.
- Updating a version does not create a historical version.
- Repeating the same key/version request does not create a second row in normal single-session execution.
- Different versions for the same key can coexist as separate rows.
- Version ordering is not enforced by POST.
- GET orders prompts by `prompt_key.asc(), id.desc()`.

There is no optimistic locking, server-generated version, or conflict response for stale edits.

## Active And Default Rules

Current rules:

- `is_active` is assigned directly on the target row.
- `is_default` is assigned directly on the target row.
- Setting a new default does not unset existing defaults.
- Setting a new active prompt does not deactivate older prompt rows.
- Multiple prompts can be active.
- Multiple prompts can be default.

This preserves legacy behavior but leaves product policy undefined.

## Seed Behavior

Task 9C.4Q moved POST seed ownership into the prompt mutation application service. The configuration route still runs seed for the GET prompt listing, but the POST branch delegates directly to the callback and the callback delegates to the service.

Current POST flow:

1. Admin auth succeeds.
2. `prompt_post_handler(user)` constructs `LegacyPromptMutationRequest`.
3. `execute_legacy_prompt_mutation(...)` calls the seed dependency.
4. Missing provider/model/prompt defaults may be added and flushed.
5. The service performs the prompt upsert.
6. The service commits once.

The seed service still does not own commit or rollback. The prompt mutation service owns the one mutation commit and explicit rollback for validation, seed, persistence, and commit failures.

## Transaction Matrix

| Path | Seed flush | Prompt create/update | Commit | Explicit rollback | Persistence |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| unauthorized | no | no | no | no | none |
| non-admin | no | no | no | no | none |
| malformed JSON | no service call | no | no | no | Flask JSON parsing returns the existing 400 behavior |
| empty JSON object | no | no | no | yes | no seed or prompt persistence |
| non-object JSON | no stable mutation | no | no | no service rollback | current error path returns 500 under no-propagation testing before a typed request exists |
| create | yes | create one `PromptTemplate` if missing | yes | yes on failure | seed plus prompt persist only on service commit |
| update same key/version | yes | update existing `PromptTemplate` in place | yes | yes on failure | seed plus prompt update persist only on service commit |
| commit failure | yes | pending prompt mutation is rolled back | attempted | yes | no prompt row remains; scoped session can recover |

The service now implements the Task 9C.4P transaction requirement: one commit on success and explicit rollback on failure.

## Write-set

Successful mutation can write:

- missing `AIProviderConfig` seed rows;
- missing `AIModelRegistry` seed rows;
- missing `PromptTemplate` seed rows;
- target `PromptTemplate` row.

Successful mutation does not write:

- `AICallLog`;
- `AlignmentProviderUsageRecord`;
- `AlignmentVerificationRun`;
- `AlignmentProviderPreflightRun`;
- `AlignmentProviderPolicy`;
- `ConceptAlignmentCard`;
- `AuditRecord`.

## Permissions And Actor

The route is admin-only.

Denied users do not trigger seed and do not write prompt rows:

- unauthenticated: 401;
- student: 403;
- teacher: 403;
- reviewer: 403;
- admin: allowed.

For a newly created prompt, `created_by` is set to the current admin user id if it was previously empty. Existing `created_by` is preserved.

## Audit And Logging

No prompt mutation `AuditRecord` is written by the current implementation.

The current response does not include full prompt template text, full request JSON, unknown credential-like fields, traceback, Authorization, Cookie, or API key fields.

## Frontend Dependency

`frontend/index.html` currently calls only:

- `GET /api/admin/ai/prompts`

No direct frontend `POST /api/admin/ai/prompts` call was found in the current single-file frontend. The POST route remains in OpenAPI and tests, so it is still part of the compatibility surface.

## OpenAPI

`docs/openapi.yaml` lists `POST /api/admin/ai/prompts` as "Create or update an AI prompt template".

OpenAPI currently marks these fields as required:

- `prompt_key`
- `prompt_version`
- `task_type`
- `template_text`

Production code only requires:

- `prompt_key`
- `prompt_version`

This is an existing mismatch. Task 9C.4O records it but does not change OpenAPI or production behavior.

## No-network And Secret Safety

Characterization tests block:

- `socket`;
- `urllib`;
- `requests`;
- `httpx`.

Static checks confirm the mutation callback does not call provider adapter, provider transport, legacy healthcheck executor, or provider selection execution. The route does not use real LLMs.

Sentinel: `LEXIBRIDGE_SENTINEL_SECRET_9C4O`.

The sentinel is not returned in API responses and is not persisted when supplied in unknown credential-like metadata fields.

## Concurrency And Consistency Risks

Current risks:

- Two admins can update the same prompt version with last-write-wins behavior.
- Two sessions can concurrently create the same `prompt_key` + `prompt_version` because no explicit database uniqueness constraint is present.
- Duplicate default prompts can exist.
- Duplicate active prompts can exist.
- There is no optimistic locking or version precondition.
- Seed lookup-before-create has the same race profile documented for the seed service.
- Commit failure now rolls back in the application service, but duplicate/concurrency risks remain.

These risks do not block characterization, but they do block treating this as a simple route-move task.

## Future Boundary Split

Future work should separate:

| Boundary | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| HTTP adapter | auth, JSON parsing, legacy response envelope |
| Prompt validation | required fields, data coercion, JSON schema/template validation |
| Prompt version/default policy | create/update/version semantics, active/default exclusivity if required |
| Prompt mutation service | established in `backend/services/legacy_provider_prompt_mutation.py`; owns seed integration, lookup, mutation plan, persistence orchestration |
| Transaction owner | application service now owns one commit and explicit rollback |
| Response mapping | legacy envelope and serializer compatibility |

## Task 9C.4P Policy Decision

Task 9C.4P accepts `docs/adr/ADR-legacy-prompt-mutation-policy.md` as the compatibility policy for the current small pilot.

Policy name: `LEGACY_PROMPT_MUTABLE_REVISION_V1`.

Status: `ACCEPTED_FOR_SMALL_PILOT`.

The policy explicitly treats `POST /api/admin/ai/prompts` as a legacy mutable revision upsert, not as production-grade immutable prompt version control.

## Compatibility Policy Matrix

| Concern | Current compatibility policy | Future production policy |
|---|---|---|
| Identity | `(prompt_key, prompt_version)` after runtime stringification and stripping. Matching is case-sensitive. Provider, model, task type, language, active, and default are not part of identity. | Formalize identity in migration-backed schema, likely with a unique constraint or dedicated prompt identity/version tables. |
| Version mutability | `LEGACY_MUTABLE_REVISION`: the client supplies an opaque non-empty `prompt_version`; same key/version can be updated in place. | Immutable versions or explicit revision records, with content changes requiring a new version or an explicit revision operation. |
| Upsert | Missing key/version creates one `PromptTemplate`; existing key/version updates the first matching row in place. | Separate create/update/new-version operations with explicit conflict behavior. |
| History | No immutable history is generated; overwritten content is not queryable through this endpoint. | Historical version query semantics and retained immutable revision rows. |
| Duplicate prevention | Sequential repeated requests should not create a second row, but true concurrent creation is not protected by schema. Existing duplicate logical rows are resolved by the current first-row lookup behavior. | `unique(prompt_key, prompt_version)` or equivalent conflict-safe identity enforcement. |
| Concurrency | `SINGLE_WRITER_LAST_COMMIT_WINS`; operationally assumes one admin editor in the small pilot. | Multi-admin concurrency policy with row-version tokens, ETag/If-Match, or equivalent optimistic locking. |
| Lost update | Lost updates are possible; the last successful commit determines stored content. | Detect stale writes and return a conflict response such as HTTP 409. |
| Active/default | Direct row assignment is preserved if fields are supplied. Active/default exclusivity, archive, activate, and deactivate workflows are out of scope. | Define active/default product semantics and enforce with constraints or transactional updates if required. |
| Validation | Runtime compatibility source: `prompt_key` and `prompt_version` are required; other fields follow current fallback/coercion behavior; unknown fields are ignored. | Versioned API contract with stricter validation, length limits, schema validation, and documented error codes. |
| OpenAPI | Runtime contract wins for compatibility. OpenAPI currently overstates required fields by requiring `task_type` and `template_text`; this task does not change OpenAPI. | Align OpenAPI with the chosen production API in a separate contract task. |
| Transaction | Application service owns one commit for seed plus prompt mutation; the callback no longer commits. | Application service with explicit transaction boundaries and well-defined retry/conflict behavior. |
| Rollback | Application service explicitly rolls back validation, seed, persistence, and commit failures while preserving external error contracts. | Standardized rollback and error mapping across mutation services. |
| Audit | No `AuditRecord` is written today. | Add safe prompt mutation audit events only through a separate audit contract task. |
| Migration | No schema change; SQLite/additive migration limitations remain. | Formal migration framework before adding uniqueness, immutable history, locking tokens, or active/default constraints. |

## Task 9C.4Q Application Service

Task 9C.4Q establishes `backend/services/legacy_provider_prompt_mutation.py`.

Public API:

- `LEGACY_PROMPT_MUTATION_POLICY = "LEGACY_PROMPT_MUTABLE_REVISION_V1"`
- `LegacyPromptMutationRequest.from_payload(payload, actor_user_id=...)`
- `LegacyPromptMutationDependencies(db, PromptTemplate, current_time_text, safe_json_loads, seed_registry)`
- `LegacyPromptMutationResult(...)`
- `execute_legacy_prompt_mutation(request=..., dependencies=...)`

The service implements:

1. runtime-compatible validation for `prompt_key` and `prompt_version`;
2. registry seed through the injected seed callable;
3. lookup by `(prompt_key, prompt_version)`;
4. mutable revision create/update;
5. exactly one commit on success;
6. explicit rollback on validation, seed, persistence, or commit failure;
7. a typed result that lets the callback preserve the legacy envelope.

It must not implement immutable versions, unique constraints, OpenAPI-only required fields, active/default exclusivity, prompt mutation audit records, provider transport, or `/api/alignment/run` behavior.

The POST route is still not extracted. It remains wired through the shared `admin_ai_prompts` route in `backend/routes/legacy_provider_admin_configuration.py` and the app callback in `backend/app.py`.

## Final Conclusion

Task 9C.4O primary conclusion: `PROMPT_VERSIONING_OR_CONCURRENCY_POLICY_REQUIRED_FIRST`.

Task 9C.4P policy conclusion: `LEGACY_PROMPT_MUTABLE_REVISION_V1` is accepted for the current local/small-pilot compatibility surface.

Task 9C.4Q service conclusion: `APPLICATION_SERVICE_ESTABLISHED`; `POST_ROUTE_NOT_YET_EXTRACTED`.

Reasoning:

- The current operation is an upsert, not a fully specified create/update/version workflow.
- Versioning is client-supplied and updates are in-place.
- Default and active flags are not globally managed.
- No uniqueness or optimistic locking policy is present for prompt key/version updates.
- Commit failure now has service-level rollback.
- OpenAPI required fields are stricter than the actual implementation.

The next safe step is route extraction of the now-thin POST HTTP adapter. That task must preserve the shared `/api/admin/ai/prompts` path and `admin_ai_prompts` endpoint while removing the configuration route module's temporary dependency on an app-owned mutation callback.
